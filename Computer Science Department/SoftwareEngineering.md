####About the Course

Spiritual sequel to Peter Thiel's [CS183](http://blakemasters.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup) course on startups. Bridges the gap between academic computer science and production software engineering. Fast-paced introduction to key tools and techniques (command line, dotfiles, text editor, distributed version control, debugging, testing, documentation, reading code, deployments), featuring guest appearances by senior engineers from successful startups and large-scale academic projects. Over the course of the class, students will build a command line application, expose it as a web service, and then link other students' applications and services together to build an HTML5 mobile app. General principles are illustrated through modern Javascript and the latest web technologies, including Node, Backbone, Coffeescript, Bootstrap, Git, and Github.

#### Searls Commentary

This intensive 12 week course covers the bases of software engineering as it is purpotedly practiced in Silicon Valley, emphasizing command line programming with a large suite of web technologies and standalone tools *du jour*. It is unique in alternating lessons in hard-core computing with discussions of the business aspects of startups, and involves the actual web deployment of a student product. The course feels like drinking from a fire hose but total immersion should put you well on your way to being capable of deploying major bioinformatics applications.
