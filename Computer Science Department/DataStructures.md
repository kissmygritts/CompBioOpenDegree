### Data Structures

[Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI)  
Kevin Wayne and Robert Sedgewick  
Princeton University

#### About the Course

This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Part I covers basic iterable data types, sorting, and searching algorithms.

An introduction to fundamental data types, algorithms, and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Specific topics covered include: union-find algorithms; basic iterable data types (stack, queues, and bags); sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort, heapsort) and applications; priority queues; binary search trees; red-black trees; hash tables; and symbol-table applications.

#### Searls Commentary

Although labeled Algorithms, these courses cover data structures in some depth and together are typical of a particularly thorough second course in computer science; in fact, over a quarter of all Princeton undergraduates take the classroom version. Java is required, though not a deep knowledge of it, making this an opportunity for students of bioinformatics to pick up another relevant language with a little extra self-study. One major caveat is that Princeton, for reasons allits own, does not issue certificates or any other acknowledgement of participation, which may be a showstopper for some online learners with specific career goals.
