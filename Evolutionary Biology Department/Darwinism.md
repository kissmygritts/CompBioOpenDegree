####About the Course

Charles Darwin launched a sweeping new theory of life in his epic book, On the Origins of Species (1895). The theory opened eyes and minds around the world to a radical new understanding of the flora and fauna of the planet. Here, Darwin showed for the first time that no supernaturla processes are necessary to explain the profusion of living beings on earth, that all organisms past and present are related in a historical branching pattern of descent, and that human beings fall into place quite naturally in the web of all life. The lectures are with leading Darwin scholars from around the country to learn about Darwon's far-reaching legacy in fields as diverse as anthropology, religion, medicine, psychology, philosophy, literature, and biology.

####Searls Commentary

This non-MOOC course could perhaps be more acurately titled the "History of Evolutionary Thought," and there is no better way to approach this than to study Darwin himself. Darwin's bicentenary is beginning to fade into memory, but it was the occasion for a number of courses and seminars that are still of value for historical, philosophical and scietific perspectives on the theory of evolution. This was on of the best.
