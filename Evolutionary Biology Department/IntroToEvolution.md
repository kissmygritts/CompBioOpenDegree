#### About the Course

The AMNH course Evolution: A Course for Educators provides an overview of biological evolution for educators. Informed by the recently released Next Generation Science Standards, the course explores the history of evolutionary theory and the evidence that supports it. We will learn about patterns of human evolution and societal implications of modern evolutionary biology, and how scientists determine relatedness among living and extinct organisms. Course participants will bring their understanding of course themes - along with content resources, discussion questions, and assignments - into their own teaching.

#### Searls Commentary

The course is designed for teachers and in four weeks provides only a taste of the main topics surrounding evolution, but it serves as a quick introduction for utter novices and pays appropriate attention to Darwin. Assessment includes a short peer-reviewed essay, which is common for MOOCs in the humanities but less so in the sciences.
