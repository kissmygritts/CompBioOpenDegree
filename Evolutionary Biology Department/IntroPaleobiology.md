#### Introduction to Paleobiology

[Emergence of Life](https://www.coursera.org/course/emergenceoflife)  
Bruce W. Fouke, Ph.D.

#### About the Course

This course will evaluate the entire history of life on earth within the context of our cutting-edge understanding of the tree of life. This includes the pioneering work of Professor Carl Woese on the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campus which revolutionized our understanding with a new "Tree of Life". Other themes include reconnaissance of ancient primordial life before the first cell evolved, the entire 4 billion year development of life through the lens of the tree of life, the influence of earth system processes on shaping the structure of the tree of life. This synthesis empahsizes the universality of the emergence of life as a prelude for the search for extraterrestrial life.

#### Searls Commentary

The starting point for this course is the work of Carl Woese (much of it on the Urbana-Champaign campus hosting this course) that helped establish the molecular basis for our modern understanding of the "tree of life." This makes for useful background to computational approaches to phylogenetic studies of the early stages of evolution.
