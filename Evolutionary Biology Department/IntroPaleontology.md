### Intoduction to Paleontology

[origins -- Formation of the Universe, Solar System, Earth and Life](https://www.coursera.org/course/origins)  
University of Copenhagen

#### About the Course

The history of our planet and Solar System, during an interval of almost 5 billion years, is controlled by a series of key biological and geological processes. The course will investigate the prehistory and origins of our Solar System, the Earth and its tectonic processes, the origin of life and the evolution of the complex marine and terrestrial ecosystems that have uniquely defined our planet.

The course is taught by a broad range of specialists from the Natural History Museum of Denmark, University of Copenhagen. The extensive collections at the museum will be used throughout the course to illustrate what we know and why we know it.

#### Searls Commentary

 Paleontology, the geologic perspective on the origin and evolution of life, is very broadly drawn by the syllabus of this course. For computational biologists, it may be of interest mostly insofar as it sets the stage for other courses.
