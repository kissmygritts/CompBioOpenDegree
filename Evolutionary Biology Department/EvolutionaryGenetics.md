### Evolutionary Genetics

[Introduction to Genetics and Evolution](https://www.coursera.org/course/geneticsevolution "Coursera MOOC")  
Dr. Mohamed Noor  
Duke University

####About the Course

A whirlwind introduction to evolution and genetics, from basic principles to current applications, including how disease genes are mapped, areas or research in evolutionary genetics, and how we leverage evolutionary concepts to aid humanity.

Introduction to Genetics and Evolution is a college-level class being offered simultaneously to new students at Duke University. The course gives interested people a very basic overview of some principles behind these very fundamental areas of biology.  We often hear about new "genome sequences," commercial kits that can tell you about your ancestry (including pre-human) from your DNA or disease predispositions, debates about the truth of evolution, why animals behave the way they do, and how people found "genetic evidence for natural selection."  This course provides the basic biology you need to understand all of these issues better, tries to clarify some misconceptions, and tries to prepare students for future, more advanced coursework in Biology.  No prior coursework is assumed.

####Course Format
Coursera MOOC.  
Lecture videos with integrated quizes. There will be 2 test assessments, including a non-cumulative final exam.

####Searls Commentary

This course overlaps with the basic genetics course in the Biology Department insofar as it covers introductory genetics, but only to the extent necessary to engage with the main topic of population and evolutionary genetics. Even so, it only covers the latter subjects at an introductory level. Nevertheless there arer hands-on exercises in mapping, heritability, Hardy-Weinberg analysis, measurment of selective pressure, etc. that make it a worthwile extension and the instructor has the personality to keep students involved. Also of interest is a free iPhone app developed by a student in the course that implements several of the quantitative aspects of the course.
