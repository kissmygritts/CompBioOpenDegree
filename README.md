##Open Computational Biology Open Source

I recently came across an paper on PLoS that layed out the framework for an open source degree in computational biology. The course work is a compilation of MOOCs, video lectures and open courseware from around the internet. Many are great, some not so great. This is a bit a proof that you can indeed learn anything on the internet!

I decided to turn this paper into an interactive GitBook (in progress). I'm transcribing all the information from Searls paper in markdown files, adding information from the course websites and fixing some link errors, etc. This will always be a work in progress as course availability will change, new courses are added and courses or dropped. 

A compilation of MOOCs and OpenCourseware compiled by David B. Searls:
