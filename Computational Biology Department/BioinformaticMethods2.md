#### About the Course

Large-scale biology projects such as the sequencing of the human genome and gene expression surveys using RNA-seq, microarrays and other technologies have created a wealth of data for biologists. However, the challenge facing scientists is analyzing and even accessing these data to extract useful information pertaining to the system being studied. This course focuses on employing existing bioinformatic resources – mainly web-based programs and databases – to access the wealth of data to answer questions relevant to the average biologist, and is highly hands-on. 

Use of available (mainly web-based) programs for analyzing biological data. This is an introductory course with a strong emphasis on hands-on methods. Some theory is introduced, but the main focus is on using extant bioinformatics tools to analyze data and generate biological hypotheses.

The first part, Bioinformatic Methods I, dealt with databases, Blast, multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetics, selection analysis and metagenomics.

#### Searls Commentary

This course is centered on labs involving the use of standard, usually web-based tools. It is designed for biologists but should also serve to familiarize computer scientists with the landscape of existing methods. This is almost purely a practical, hands-on course, conveying just enough informtatino about the algorithms to support their intelligent use, in fairly cursory lectures. There is a heavy focus on plants, reflecting the instructor's background, but of course the methods are general. The assessments are largely cookbook,a nd have as much to do with navigating web resources as employing the tools, but that is much of what constitutes end-user bioinformatics today.
