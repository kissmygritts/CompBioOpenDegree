#### About the Course

Computational Molecular Biology is a practical, hands-on approach to the field of computational molecular biology. The course is recommended for both molecular biologists and computer scientists desiring to understand the major issues concerning analysis of genomes, sequences and structures. Various existing methods will be critically described and the strengths and limitations of each will be discussed. There will be practical assignments utilizing the tools described. All homework and coursework will be submitted electronically. Prerequisites include an introductory molecular biology course at the level of Biology 41 or permission of the instructor. Students who have not had a course in molecular biology may acquire the necessary background by reading either Stryer's Biochemistry (5th edition by Berg, Tymoczko and Stryer) or Lewin's Genes IX.
