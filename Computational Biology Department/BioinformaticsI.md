#### About the Course

This course begins a series of classes illustrating the power of computing in modern biology. Please join us on the frontier of bioinformatics to look for hidden messages in DNA without ever needing to put on a lab coat. After warming up our algorithmic muscles, we will learn how randomized algorithms can be used to solve problems in bioinformatics.

A genome may look like an incomprehensible string of the letters A, C, G, and T. Yet hidden in the three billion nucleotides of your genome is a secret language. This course offers an introduction to how we can start to understand this language by using algorithms to find hidden messages in DNA.

What do these hidden messages say?  In the first chapter of the course, hidden DNA messages indicate where a bacterium starts replicating its genome, a problem with applications in bioengineering and beyond. In the second chapter, hidden DNA messages tell us how organisms know whether it is day or night as well as how the bacterium causing tuberculosis is able to hide from antibiotics. We will see how randomized algorithms, which toss coins and roll dice, can be used to find these messages.

Each of the two central topics in the course builds the algorithmic knowledge required to address this challenge. Along the way, coding challenges and exercises, many of which ask you to apply your skills to real genetic data, will be directly integrated into the text at the exact moment they are needed.

#### Searls Commentary

This course is an in-depth exploration of a wide range of algorithms important for modern sequence analysis. It makes use of a custom-built educational platform called Stepic, essentially an e-book that is closely integrated with graded programming challenges implemented in the language of your choice. the grading is Stepic is in turn integrated with the Coursera platform, and while there is occasional downtime the arrangement works fairly well overall. The main disadvantage of Stepic is that it is complete and self-contained, such that the student is given little incentive to watch the separate videos of lectures by Pavel Pevzner, which are terrific.
