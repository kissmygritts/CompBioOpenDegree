#### Searls Commentary

This course was put together as backgroung preperation for students embarking on field work in Kenya. While it includes lectures in general topics like network analysis and machine learning, there are also more directed talks on population biology and ecology, behavioral ecology, and collective behavior. online auditors can only envy (or not) the students going on from this to do projects in the wild, but either way this course provides an interesting insight into interdisciplinary studies in this field.
