#### About the Course

Biologists still cannot read the nucleotides of an entire genome or the amino acids of an antibiotic as you would read a book from beginning to end. However, they can read short pieces of DNA and weigh small antibiotic fragments. In this course, we will see how graph theory and brute force algorithms can be used to reconstruct genomes and antibiotics.

In "Finding Hidden Messages in DNA", we discussed how to separate some of the signal from the apparent noise of DNA sequences.  But how do we know what the DNA sequence making up a genome is in the first place?  After all, DNA nucleotides are far too small to view with a normal microscope, and biologists still do not possess technology that would read all the nucleotides of your genome from beginning to end.

In the first chapter of this course, we will see that entire genomes are assembled from millions of short overlapping pieces of DNA.  The scale of this problem (the human genome is 3 billion nucleotides long!) implies that computers must be involved. Yet the problem is even more complex than it may appear ... to solve it, we will need to travel back in time to meet three famous mathematicians, and learn about algorithms based on graph theory.

In the second chapter of the course, we will consider antibiotics, which are mini-proteins engineered by bacteria to fight each other. Determining the sequence of amino acids making up an antibiotic is an important problem for medical research, but the practical barriers to sequencing an antibiotic containing just 10 amino acids are often more substantial than the limitations when assembling a genome with 10 million nucleotides! To decode the amino acid sequence of an antibiotic, biologist must blast many copies of this antibiotic into pieces and use an expensive molecular scale to weigh the resulting fragments. It may not seem possible that we can determine an antibiotic just from the masses of these fragments, but we will see that brute force algorithms will often succeed.
