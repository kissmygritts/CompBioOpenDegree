## Mathematics Department

### Courses
**Calculus One**  
An introduction to differential calculus. Functions and limits to Techniques of Integration.

**Calculus Two**  
An introduction to sequences, infinite series, convergence tests and Taylor series. The course emphasizes not just getting answers, but asking the questions "why is this true?"

**Differential Equations**  
The laws of nature are expressed as differential equations. Scientists and engineers must know how to model the world in terms of differential equations, and how to solve those equations and interpret the solution. This course focuses on the equations and techniques most useful in science and engineering.

**Linear Algebra**  
Learn the concepts and methods of linear algebra, and how to use them to think about computational problems arising in computer science. Coursework includes building on the concepts to write small programs and run them on real data.

**Abstract Algebra**  
Algebra is the language of modern mathematics. This course introduces students to that language through a study of groups, group actions, vector spaces, linear algebra and the theory of fields.

**Real Analysis**  
This course is a rigorous analysis of the real numbers, as well as an introduction to writing and communicating mathematics well.

**Complex Analysis**  
This course explores complex analysis, complex dynamics and some applications of these topics. Introductino to complex numbers, their geometry and algebra and working with complex numbers.

**Functional Analysis**  
Functional analysis is the branch of mathematics dealing with spaces of functions. It is a valuable tool in theoretical mathematics as well as engineering. It is at the very core of numerical simulations.

**Topology**  
A first course in algebraic topology, with emphasis on visualization, geometric intuition and simplified computations.

**Discrete Mathematics**  
This course covers elementary discrete mathematics for computer science and engineering. It emphasizes mathematical definitions and proofs as well as applicable methods.

**Combinatorics**  
Objects: sets, permutations, partitions, compositions, trees, posets, polytopes, etc. methods: bijections, generating functions, Mobius inversion, algebraic and topological methods

**Probability**  
Probabilistic modeling and the related field of statistical inference are the key to analyzing data and making scientifically sound predictions.

**Logic**  
A basic introduction to logic. It shows how to formalize information in the form of logical sentences. It shows how to reason systematically with this information to produce all logical conclusions and only logical conclusions.

**Theory of Computation**  
This course covers finite automata, context-free grammars, Turing machines, undecidable problems, and intractable problems (NP-completeness).

**Linear Programming**  
This course will cover the very basic ideas in optimization. Topics include the basic theory and algorithms behind linear and integer linear programming along with some important applications.

**Numerical Methods**  
A survey of numerical solution techniques for ordinary and partial differential equations. Emphasis will be on the application of numerical schemes to practical problems in the engineering and physical sciences.

**Dynamical Systems**  
Discrete maps, continuous flows, dynamical systems, Poincare maps, symbolic dynamics, chaos, strange attractors, fractals, computer simulation of dynamical systems.

**Signal Processing**  
This course will teach students to analyze discrete-time signals and systems in both the time and frequency domains. Students will learn convolution, discrete Fourier transforms, the z-transform, and digital filtering.

**Information Theory**  
This course is an introduction to information theory, which emphasizes fundamental concepts as well as analytical techniques.

**Game Theory**  
Mathematical modeling of strategic interactions among rational (and irrational) agents. This course will provide the basics: representing games as strategies, the extensive form, Bayesian games, repeated and stochastic games and more.

**Graph Theory**  
In computer science, graph theory is used extensively. The intension of this course is to introduce the subject of graph theory to computer science students in a thorough way.
